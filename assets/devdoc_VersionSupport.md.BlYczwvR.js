This image is currently based on ubuntu 22.04 and contains the majority of packages users will require.</p><p>b) Use your own hardened base image, and install the containerized package that we publish into that image.</p><h2 id="package-versions" tabindex="-1">Package versions. <a class="header-anchor" href="#package-versions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Package versions.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We currently generate the following versions of the package and images:</p><ul><li>debug</li><li>release with symbols</li><li>release without symbols.</li></ul><p>It is recommended that you deploy the &quot;release with symbols&quot; version to all bare-metal and non-production cloud deployments. The extra symbols allow the system to generate stack backtraces which make it much easier to diagnose problems if they occur. The &quot;release without symbols&quot; version is recommended for Kubernetes production deployments. Deploying a system without symbols reduces the size of the images. This reduces the time it takes Kubernetes to copy the image before provisioning a new node.</p>',27)]))}const m=t(o,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
