//This is a obscure test for the event generation and processing capabilities of the workflow engine.

//If two instances of this query are run at the same time it can cause problems.  Both will generate an
//event, but the event from one workunit will be sent to both workunits.  The respoonse in stage 2 is
//coded to be sent back to the workunit that generated it.  This means the 1st workunit receives two result
//events, and the 2nd workunit receives none.

//Ideally there would be a filter on the event that would allow an event from a different workunit to be
//rejected.

//To avoid problems in the regression suite (when roxie and hthor are run at the same time) use an
//event name that is based on the target platform.
