Questions arising out of walking through the sketched out implementation:

How do split points fit in?   They can be used when distribution does not need to be preserved.
When are locations resolved?  Likely to be late on the agent nodes which allows better fallback, and potentially hot swapping to a backup copy.
What information is signed?  The entire blob of xml that comes back from the esp service is signed.
How do we reuse buffering classes cleanly?

Implementing FETCH and partition reading required basic interface to request reading for a range of the file.  Fits in well with the range support of S3/azure
