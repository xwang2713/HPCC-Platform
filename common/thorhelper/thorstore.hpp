/*
 * File processing sequence:
 *
 * a) create a CLogicalFileCollection
 *   A) with an implicit superfile
 *      process each of the implicit subfiles in turn
 *      Do we allow logical files and
 *   B) with a logical super file
 *      process each of the subfiles in turn
 *   C) With a logical file
 *      - Resolve the file
 *      - extract the file information from dali
 *      - extract the split points (from dali/disk).
 *        potentially quite large, and expensive?  May want a hint to indicate how many ways the file will be read
 *        to avoid retrieving if there will be no benefit.
 *   D) With a absolute filename  [<host>|group?][:port]//path   (or local path if contains a /)
 *      - NOTE: ./abc can be used to refer to a physical file in the current directory
 *      - Add as a single (or multiple) part physical file, no logical distribution.
 *      - not sure if we should allow the port or not.  Could be used to force use of dafilesrv??
 *      - Need to check access rights - otherwise could extract security keys etc.
 *   E) As a URL transport-protocol://path
 *      - Expand wild cards (or other magic) to produce a full list of parts and nodes.  No logical distribution.
 *      - Retrieve meta information for the file
 *      - Retrieve partition information for the parts.
 *      - possibly allow thor:array//path as another representation for (D).  What would make sense?
 *   F) FILE::...
 *      Check access rights, then translate to same as (D)
 *   G) REMOTE::...
 *      Call into the remote esp to extract the file information and merge it with the location information
 *
 * b) perform protocol dependent processing
 *    - possibly part of stage (a) or a separate phase
 *    - passing #parts that it will be read from to allow split information to be optimized.
 *    A) thor
         - Translate logical nodes to physical ips.
         - gather any missing file sizes
      B) s3/azure blobs
         - Expand any wildcards in the filenames and create entries for each expanded file.
         - gather file sizes
      C) HDFS
         - gather files sizes
         - gather split points
 * c) serialize to the slaves
 * d) deserialize from the master
 * e) call fileCollection::partition(numChannels, myChannel) to get a list of partitions
 * f) iterate though the partitions for the current channel
 *    a) need a reader for the format - how determine?
 *    b) Where we determine if it should be read directly or via dafilesrv?
 *    c) request a row reader for the
 *
 * Questions:
 *    Where are the translators created?
 *    What is signed?  It needs to be a self contained block of data that can easily be serialized and deserialized.
 *      I don't think it needs to contain information about the storage array - only the logical file.
